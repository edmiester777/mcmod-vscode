# MCModCrafter #

The MCModCrafter project is designed to help people new to minecraft modding, or
software engineering in general, to learn how to develop minecraft mods like a
pro.

## What makes this application amazing? ##
This program helps people learn in three stages:

#### Stage 1 - Wizard ####
The mod wizard is a dynamic UI that allows newbies to develop mods by editing
predefined fields. This makes a person who has never experienced the
complexities of developing software to jump right in and experience the magic of
software development without the massive learning curve.

#### Stage 2 - Nodal editor ####
The nodal editor takes generated code from the wizard stage to construct a nodal
logic editor. A more advanced user may also bypass the wizard phase and jump
right to the nodal editor. This nodal editor works much like UE4s blueprint
editor, and allows users to edit logic without knowing everything about java
code. I feel that this step is crucial to understanding the logic and flow of
software when first being introduced to the subject.

#### Stage 3 - Source editor ####
Congratulations! They've made it! They learned enough about the inner workings
of the mod to where they can view and edit generated code by the nodal editor
stage.
